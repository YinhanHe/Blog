# Stochastic Optimization
## Brief Intro
This is a reading conclusion of **Stochastic Optimization** from Lauren A.Hannah. Stochastic optimization is optimization with randomness is present(either objective function or constraints). Main division is single stage problem(i.e. problems with a single time period, try to find single optimal dicision) and multistage problems(multiple time preriods, try to find an optimal sequence of decisions, such as scheduling water releases from hydroelectric plants over two year period).
## Single Stage Stochastic Optimization
This is an optimization situated at non-subsequent recourse decisions. Here is example:
$$\delta$$
